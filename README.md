# The War Within

A Game Design University project aimed at the designing process for a World War 1 game featuring no combat.

The game is narrative based. A Solider who fought in the Great War became inflicted with PTSD. The idea behind a heavy focus on narrative is to also bring an increased awareness to War deriven Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder which inflicts soliders at War that fight to protect our lives and countries everyday.

Being a sensitive subject, sensitivity was the upmost importance thoughout the project maintaining respect of those who are affected by PTSD. 
The inclusion of Stealth and Puzzle gameplay aided the progression of the overarcing narrative while placing the player at the centre of the character's journey.

First-person gameplay featured in the 'Corridor' levels attempts to allow the player to feel disorientated and confused, while also providing the sense of entrapment in an ongoing loop. The Stealth and Puzzle levels are flashbacks to key points in the character's time during the War in the initial stages of PTSD had developed. Fighting a War for global peace, he is able to fight his own internal struggle with the gimmers of hope he recieves from his family back home.

The Letter Delievery puzzle levels in retrospect is the least compelling area of the game where something a little more interactive or involved could be used in its place.
