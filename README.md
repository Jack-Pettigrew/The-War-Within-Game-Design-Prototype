# The War Within

A Game Design University project aimed designing a World War 1 game without combat.

I chose to design a game around a central narrative based on a solider who fought in the War while becoming inflicted with PTSD during his time. My idea behind a heavy focus on narrative is to also use this project as an oppotunity to bring an increased awareness to War deriven Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder which inflicts soliders at War that protect our lives and countries everyday.

Being a sensitive subject, I feel I was able to maintain the necessary amount of sensitivity to the project that I could in order to be respectful of those who are indeed affected by PTSD. The inclusion of stealth and puzzle gameplay aided the progression of the overarcing narrative while engaging the player, allowing them to feel part to the character's journey.

First-person gameplay featured in the 'corridor' levels allows the player to feel disorientated and confused, while also giving the sense of being trapped in a forever returning loop. The Stealth and Puzzle levels are flashbacks to key points in the character's time during the War which initiated his PTSD and his gradual return to mental stability, thanks to a letter he recieves from his family.

The Puzzle level I feel is the least compelling area of the game where I could have designed something a little more interactive or involved for the player to do, but I have left it as it is now as this is my submitted assignment where I gave an unbaised presentation infront of lecturers about the positives and negatives of my overall design.

Overall, I feel I was able to successfully create a narrative-drive WWI game with involved elements and a over-arching story line which is relatable not only to those with PTSD, but those without. Bringing understanding towards those who are afflicted.
